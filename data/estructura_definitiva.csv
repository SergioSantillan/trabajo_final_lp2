School smartphone ban results in better sleep and improved mood: study,"School smartphone ban results in better sleep and improved moodPosted on 11 December 2024Psychologists at the University of York, who tested the impact that smartphones have on children’s behaviour for a new two-part documentary series for Channel 4, found that a ban in school impacted positively on sleep and mood.
They found that students in the phone ban group experienced notable improvements in their sleep.
Mood boostChildren in the phone ban group also went to bed on average, 50 minutes earlier during the phone ban weeks compared to the week before the phone ban, for example, bedtime was 10:12 pm one-week post ban, and 11:02 pm the week before the ban.
Pupils in the phone ban group reported a 17% reduction in feelings related to depression and an 18% reduction in feelings related to anxiety, feeling generally less upset and nervous.
Pupils who slept better even showed changes in their heart rate that signalled improved well being.",https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2024/research/school-smartphone-ban-better-sleep/,jonatron,,,https://york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2024/research/school-smartphone-ban-better-sleep/,york.ac.uk,TECH

Should programming languages be safe or powerful?,"21 Nov 2024Should a programming language be powerful and let a programmer do a lot, or should it be safe and protect the programmer from bad mistakes?
What makes a language powerful?
Safe languages can be just as powerful as their unsafe counterparts—in many cases, they are more powerful because the abstractions they create better fit the domain.
Lisp macros: unsafe but powerful #I don’t have the space here to do a deep dive into Lisp macros, but here’s the short of it: Lisp macros are just functions that receive code as data.

"The Clever Hans Effect, Iterative LLM Prompting, and Socrates' Meno","That said, philosophers like Hubert Dreyfus challenge this assumption, arguing that human intelligence is far more complex and cannot be fully replicated by machines.
In his seminal work, What Computers Can't Do, Dreyfus drew on the phenomenological tradition by emphasizing that much of human intelligence operates through lived experience, intuitive understanding, and contextual awareness.
The most recent major advancement has come in the form of truly large language models (LLMs).
By examining Socratic questioning, LLM iterative prompting, and Clever Hans’s arithmetic, we see intelligence as an emergent, relational phenomenon that arises through interaction, not isolated cognition.

How big data created the modern dairy cow,"This is the story of how the power of big data, combined with an ambitious public-private partnership between dairy farmers and the US Department of Agriculture, enabled the US to engineer the modern dairy cow and transform the dairy industry.
The cow-testing cooperatives, later renamed dairy herd improvement associations (DHIAs), provided the data dairy breeders needed to put Lush’s ideas into action.
It also centralized data from dairy farms across the country: by joining a DHIA, a dairy farmer was not only obtaining information about their own herd but also providing valuable data to dairy farmers all around the country.
Democratizing cattle geneticsThe evolution and refinement of dairy cattle genetics in the US was a sea change in the history of agriculture.

We present the first flop controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters with 4T training bytes.

An analysis published in January by the Commonwealth Fund found that, compared to other high-income countries, the US has the highest rate of adults with multiple chronic conditions, and the highest rate of obesity.
Among just those high-income countries, the US also has the shortest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of avoidable deaths, the highest rate of newborn deaths, and the highest rate of maternal deaths.
That’s all despite the fact that the US spends far more on health care than any other high-income country.",https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/americans-are-living-longer-but-most-of-the-extra-time-is-spent-being-sick/,m463,,,https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/americans-are-living-longer-but-most-of-the-extra-time-is-spent-being-sick/,arstechnica.com,LIFESTYLE

Noninvasive imaging method can penetrate deeper into living tissue,"Metabolic imaging is a noninvasive method that enables clinicians and scientists to study living cells using laser light, which can help them assess disease progression and treatment responses.
This allows them to see much further into living tissue and capture clearer images.
This animation shows deep metabolic imaging of living intact 3D multicellular systems, which were grown in the Roger Kamm lab at MIT.
“This work shows a significant improvement in terms of depth penetration for label-free metabolic imaging.

The Mercury News and seven sister news outlets are among several newspapers, including the New York Times, to sue OpenAI in the past year.
In an interview with the New York Times published Oct. 23, Balaji argued OpenAI was harming businesses and entrepreneurs whose data were used to train ChatGPT.

However, Brescic said from a long-term effectiveness standpoint, reducing the prevalence and impact of these types of attacks is still up for debate.

NASA believes it understands why Ingenuity crashed on Mars,"Eleven months after the Ingenuity helicopter made its final flight on Mars, engineers and scientists at NASA and a private company that helped build the flying vehicle said they have identified what probably caused it to crash on the surface of Mars.
Ingenuity carried no black box on board, so investigators have had to piece together their findings from limited data and imagery.
The helicopter’s navigation system tracked visual features on the surface using a downward-looking camera.
During its initial flights, Ingenuity was able to discern pebbles and other features to determine its position.
But nearly three years later, Ingenuity was flying in a region of Jezero Crater filled with steep, relatively featureless sand ripples.",https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/nasa-believes-it-understands-why-ingenuity-crashed-on-mars/,thunderbong,,,https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/nasa-believes-it-understands-why-ingenuity-crashed-on-mars/,arstechnica.com,TECH
